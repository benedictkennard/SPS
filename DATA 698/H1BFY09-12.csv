,"The chart above provides data on H-1B petitions filed requesting a cap number for fiscal years 2009 to 2012. The column entitled “Total I-129 H-1B Receipts” reflects all H-1B U.S. Master’s degree and regular cap petitions received during a specific fiscal year’s cap.  The other columns reflect action taken on each fiscal year’s H-1B cap filings, regardless of when the action occurred.  For example, a cap-subject H-1B petition that was filed on April 1, 2010 for a fiscal year 2011 cap number is included on the FY2011 row, regardless of the fiscal year in which the petition was approved, denied, or withdrawn.
 
Petitions that are ultimately revoked for reasons other than fraud are included in the “Total Approved H-1B Cap Cases” column for the specific fiscal year in which they were filed.  ""Administratively Closed"" petitions include cases that were rejected after they were data entered into the USCIS systems.  “Other Status” petitions are cases that have not yet been approved, denied, or withdrawn.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Notes:  Data in the above table includes all H-1B petitions subject to the fiscal year cap. The first 20,000 master's petitions are exempt from the cap.  All remaining master's petitions are subject to the cap. H-1B petitions may be filed up to six months before the requested employment start date.  As such, a petition with an employment start date of October 1 may be filed as early as April 1. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
