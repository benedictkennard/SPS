    "Enterococcus is a fecal indicating bacteria that lives in the intestines of humans and other warm-blooded animals. Enterococcus (“Entero”) counts are useful as a water quality indicator due to their abundance in human sewage, correlation with many human pathogens and low abundance in sewage free environments. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports Entero counts as colonies (or cells) per 100 ml of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization [Riverkeeper](http://www.riverkeeper.org/) has based its assessment of acceptable water quality on the 2012 Federal Recreational Water Quality Criteria from the US EPA. Unacceptable water is based on an illness rate of 32 per 1000 swimmers. The federal standard for unacceptable water quality is a single sample value of greater than 110 Enterococcus/100 mL, or five or more samples with a geometric mean (a weighted average) greater than 30 Enterococcus/100 mL.\n",

For safe levels, one calculation I'd do would be: EnteroCount / SampleCount. This would give the average so any number of samples greater than five and with a calculation over 30, would be unsafe. My question is how would I calculate the first criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that the geometric average of All Samples for a single day in a single station are given already! Now, If you divide by the number of samples (as you have explained above) it will provide the wrong assumption of safety when in reality is not! that is for example if we have 60 EnteroCount Based on 5 Samples we know that it is NOT safe but if you divide it, it will return 12 making it \"SAFE\" but is NOT. From my perspective, we can apply the geometric mean to compare different stations or different days/time frames.\n",

If the GM exceeds 30, water is not considered safe for swimming\" You can use the EnteroCount as follows: to calculate for example: ACROSS ALL STATIONS.
